		<TITLE>Shared Housing Project</TITLE>
		<DATE>June 2011</DATE>
		<CONTENT>
			The housing project is devised for two single residents, a botanist and an astronomer. The two have very different schedules and hobbies: the astronomer has an impressive collection of 200 pairs of shoes, while the botanist is an orchid enthusiast. The design aims to create the space the individuals need (e.g. greenhouse, observatory) while exploring the concept of public and private space. The design exercise introduces students to tectonic relations of space and structure. Staring with two separate residential spheres, I created "plug-in" structures that connect these spheres and function as shared space.

		<TITLE>Stairs</TITLE>
		<DATE>June 2011</DATE>
		<CONTENT>
			This was the first of three projects I completed at the Career Discovery program at Harvard. This  one-week exercise asked students to imagine a program for a given room, design the room for the chosen narrative, and incorporate in the design a  way to move between two portals.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; 
			The room I had designed was a black box theater for small performances (e.g. comedies, one-person plays). The initial concept was derived from the sightlines of the room and the visual focus of the audience once seated. The final design combined seating, stairs, and performance area into one integrated space.  The tiered platforms make it easy to set up layered scenic elements, while the grid provides the facility for lighting and rigging.

			Production Photos by Gokcan Demirkazik &lt;br&gt; 
			&lt;br&gt; 
			This French play is set in a brothel in an unnamed city that is experiencing revolutionary uprising in its streets. The design captures the erotic energy as well as the political upheavals the characters face. Larger-than-life paintings of sensuous, nude women flank the triptych-like doors of the brothel, while red velvet walls depict the visitors' innermost fetishes. During the revolution scenes, over 600 red bricks are raucously punched out of the structure, leaving a bare steel frame that emphasizes the destruction that is left behind.

			&lt;br&gt; 
			Set in an institution overseen by a sadistic torturer, Cleansed tells the unusual tales of love among the siblings, gay lovers, and a peep show dancer behind the fence of a concentration camp. The play explores the limits of human experience by pushing teh boundaries of theater itself. To capture Sarah Kane's brutal meditation about the nature of love, the production incorporates water and mud to create a lush environment in which the story unfolds.

			&lt;br&gt; 
			The Glass Menagerie is a memory play that revolves around the entangled lives of four characters who are all grappling with the tragedy of their own fate. In the poignant two-act play, one of the characters, Tom, references the 1937 bombing of Guernica three times.Therefore, to create the atmosphere of tension and despair, I painted the entire stage and seating area with figures from Picasso‚Äôs Guernica. In addition, the delicate floral wallpaper design was stenciled on top of crumpled, old newspaper, mimicking the style of the text found in Picasso‚Äôs masterpiece while creating context for the play.

			&lt;br&gt; 
			The play takes place in the crime-ridden streets of Dublin, where the two eponymous characters, Howie and Rookie, get entangled in a series of events that involve sex, violence, and emotional trauma. The show is set in a small and intimate theater, and the design aims to create the aesthetic of a graffitied junkyard that reflects the disarrayed nature of the story. Furthermore, standard seating in the theater is removed and a set of mismatched chairs from the props department is used to enhance the audience's experience.
